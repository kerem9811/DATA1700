Brief description of application:
This application is designed to manage cinema ticket purchases.
It encompasses a frontend with a web page, styling, and script, along with a backend H2 server.
The movie list is automatically populated from a backend table.
Users can then enter their personal information and place an order for tickets.
Input data is validated using regular expression checks and then stored on the backend H2 server.
Subsequently, a table is generated in the frontend based on data from the backend.
Users can delete individual tickets or all tickets at once.
They can also modify tickets, providing full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) capabilities.
When tickets are deleted or updated, the corresponding data is also removed from or updated in the backend.
